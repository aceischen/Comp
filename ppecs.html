        <div class="container">
            <h3>Park Cards</h3>
            <p>Before we get started, you need to pick up your Park Card from PPECS and have it validated. The Park Card is a form of Identification that tells the counter staff who you are and must be cross-referenced with your Student I.D. when you pick up equipment. Please have both with you whenever you are using Master Control and PPECS.</p>
            <p>If your major is in the Park School of Communications, you will automatically have a Park Card made for you and ready for pick up the first day of your Freshman year. If you are not in the Park School of Communications but have enrolled in a class there before the beginning of the semester, your card will be made and available on the first day of that semester. </p>
            <p>Validating your Park Card only takes a few minutes, and is for the staff at PPECS to keep all of your information up to date. You need to have your Park Card re-validated for each semester. You’ll know your card is validated when the counter staff applies a sticker with the corresponding semester and year on your card.</p>
            <p>If you lose your Park Card, you will need to order a new one for a small fee. Come to PPECS and fill out a new Park Card form, then have it signed off by Ryan Berryann, the manager of PPECS, and a new Park Card will be made for you at the I.D. office. A temporary Park Card can be provided by the counter staff in situations of need, but only after you order a replacement Park Card.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Authorizations</h3>
            <p>Now that we have our Park Cards, we need to know what you are authorized for. There are two types of resources in PPECS, reservable and non-reservable.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reservables</h4>
            <p>Reservable resources are resources that are allowed to be reserved through the Patron Portal website. These resources include cameras, lights, and equipment that is outside of the general use. Resources that can be reserved will only be available if you are in a class that authorizes you for them. This varies by semester. You will only be authorized for a resource if you are currently enrolled in a class that has that resource associated with it.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Non-Reservables</h4>
            <p>Non-reservable resources are resources that cannot be reserved through Patron Portal. This includes items such as batteries, tripods, and grip equipment (c-stands, grip heads, etc.). While these resources cannot be reserved, it can be requested in the notes section on Patron Portal (refer to the Reservations section for more on this). Certain types of non-reservable resources will be associated with reservable resources, like batteries and tripods for specific cameras. These items will follow the authorizations that their associated reservable resource does. There are non-reservable resources that are available to every student in the Park School regardless of the classes that they are enrolled in. Some of these items include: reflectors and scrims and still photo tripods.</p>
            <p>If you aren’t sure if you are authorized for something, ask! The PPECS staff is happy to help.</p>

    <section id="ppecs-reservations">
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Reservations</h3>
            <p>There are two ways to make a reservation for resources through PPECS. You may make your own reservation online at Patron Portal (find the link), or you can use the reservation desk located inside of PPECS.</p>
            <p>While reservations are not required (except when checking out resources on Friday’s), they are highly encouraged. It allows the checkout staff to prepare your orders ahead of time to not slow things down for other patrons.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Patron Portal</h4>
            <p>If you are making reservations on Patron Portal your reservation must be made at least 24 hours in advance of you picking up the equipment. Input your reservation pickup and return times before you begin, because this may affect what resources are available and for how long.</p>
            <p>Click on the add resources tab and start selecting what resources you would like! You will only be able to view what reservable equipment that you are authorized for, so if you don’t see something, you are more than likely not authorized for it.</p>
            <p>After you have selected the reservable resources that you would like, double check what you have by clicking on the cart icon on the top right of your window.</p>
            <p>After you have double checked everything, return to the first screen you were on and click “Add Notes For Checkout Staff”. This is where you will include all of your non-reservable items that you need. Please include the quantities of the resources you would like as well (for example 15 sandbags, 2 batteries, etc.).</p>
            <p>Once you have everything you need in your reservation, hit the submit button. Once your reservation has been approved by the PPECS manager, you will receive an email saying that your reservation has been approved.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reservation Desk</h4>
            <p>The reservation desk in PPECS is open from 1PM-4PM Monday through Thursday and 1PM - 3PM on Fridays.</p>
            <p>A reservation at the reservation desk does not need to be made 24 hours in advance of your pickup time, but the reservation cannot be made for the same calendar day.</p>
            <p>A PPECS checkout staff employee will assist you in creating the reservation straight into WebCheckout. They will begin by asking you your pickup and return times, and then your reservable resources, and finally your non-reservable resources. It is helpful to bring a list of what you think you will need with you, but if you have questions, they are more than happy to help.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Walk Ins</h4>
            <p>You do not need a reservation to pick up equipment unless it is Friday. THERE ARE NO WALK INS ON FRIDAYS. This is because Friday is the busiest day of the week where lots of large orders are constantly being checked out and returned. On any other day of the week however, you may come into PPECS and take out equipment. This process takes a little bit longer, because the checkout staff needs to prepare all of the resources for you on the spot without pre-checking them, so it is always recommended to make a reservation. Also, resources that you want may not be available, if you are doing a walk in.</p>

    <br>
    <section id="ppecs-pick-up" class="bg-light placeholder-spacing">
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Picking Up Resources</h3>
            <p>When picking up equipment, please show up a few minutes early to your pickup time, just to be sure that if there’s a line, you still are there on time. Keep in mind, you aren’t the only student PPECS has to help, so wait your turn. A reservation will be held for 90 minutes after the time it was supposed to be picked up, otherwise it is automatically returned in the system.</p>
            <p>When coming to pick up your resources, have your Park Card and Student I.D. ready. This is how they will verify who you are and what you are authorized for.</p>
            <p>Every item that you are picking up must be checked by an employee giving it to you, and scanned into the WebCheckout system. This is how we verify that there is no damage or faulty equipment before it leaves the building. That said, PPECS encourages the use of the break out areas for patrons to double check the equipment before leaving with it. Once you have the resource, it becomes your responsibility. You will be held accountable for any damage or misuse.</p>
            <p>Once the checkout process is completed, you must initial at the return time and sign on the last page of the equipment sign out forms. This is to verify that you assume all responsibility of the equipment and are aware of the time you are meant to return it. If you don’t return your resources on time, you will be affecting other students reservations.</p>
            <p>For larger orders there are carts that are made available to assist in transportation of the resources to vehicles or shooting locations. </p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section id="ppecs-returning" class="bg-light placeholder-spacing">
        <div class="container">
            <h3>Returning Resources</h3>
            <p>Once you have completed your shoot you must return your equipment before or at the time that you have previously specified. Please have your Park Card with you at the time of your return. If there are any problems with the equipment this is how PPECS keeps track of the Patrons responsible.</p>
            <p>Resources are scanned back into the system and inspected once more by the checkout staff upon returning. You must be present throughout the entirety of the process.</p>
            <p>Equipment is late any time you bring it back after the return time. It is up to the discretion of the checkout staff how late is too late, which would result in the removal of your Park Card.</p>
            <p>Honesty is the best policy when returning equipment. If there were any issues with resources that you had during the time you had it, please make sure to let the checkout staff know immediately. They are there to help you, and if something was wrong with a resource, they may know how to fix it. If there is damage to the equipment that you caused, this will result in the removal of your Park Card.</p>
            <p>Do not leave equipment that has a bulb or a battery in your car. These resources can be damaged by the cold. It is good practice to bring everything inside, but most importantly items that have electronics inside of them that can be directly affected by the cold.</p>
            <p>Other students need to use these resources, so it is important to take good care of them.</p>
            <p>Having your Park Card taken isn’t the end of the world. Most of the time our technical operations manager, Christian, is able to fix most pieces of equipment without having to charge you for the damages if there were any caused. Regardless, having your Park Card taken results in a conversation with the managers and a suspension of your use of PPECS for a reasonable, and generally brief amount of time.</p>
            <p>After all of the equipment has been returned, you will sign on the form underneath where you had originally signed and you should be good to go!</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>PPECS PRO</h3>
            <p>While generally the same process, PPECS Pro resources are the higher end, professional quality resources that are managed by higher level employees and made available to students in advanced cinema production, television and radio, and documentary studies and journalism courses. </p>
            <h4>Pro Hours</h4>
            <p>Monday - Friday 10AM-4PM</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Workshops</h4>
            <p>To gain access to this equipment, alongside being in an advanced course that offers Pro resources with it, you must attend a workshop and pass a test to be able to checkout the equipment.</p>
            <p>Workshops are offered during the week by PPECS Pro staff, and are organized by sign ups. At the beginning of the semester, only Thesis students and students shooting theses are allowed to sign up, but after a few weeks, all advanced courses will be allowed to sign up for the workshops. Workshops are general walkthroughs of the resources and what the ins and outs are of each of them. Then, after the walkthrough by the staff member, those attending the resource will have a chance to build the resource and break it down with the assistance of the Pro employee.</p>
            <p>After attending the workshop on the resource, the PPECS Pro staff member administering the workshop will let you know if you are ready to take the test on the resource. If they recommend re-attending the workshop, take their advice. Generally, the staff member administering the workshop will also administer the test on a separate evening and is a good judge as to whether or not you are prepared for the test.</p>
            <p>The tests are the same material as the workshops, however the staff member administering the test will not be able to assist you in the same way they did in the workshop. It is entirely up to you to complete the build up and break down of the resource to prove that you can do it efficiently, and more important, safely.</p>
            <p>After the test, the Pro employee will inform you of whether or not you have passed the test. You may always retake the test in case of a failure, but it is always recommended to take another workshop in-between tests.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reservations</h4>
            <p>After you have passed the test on the resource, you may fill out a reservation form for the resource found by the copier machine in PPECS. These forms must be signed off by the faculty member teaching the course that the resources will be used for and handed to the PPECS manager, Ryan Berryann during Pro hours.</p>
            <p>There are different forms for camera equipment, grip and lighting equipment, and audio equipment. All of them need to be signed by the faculty member.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Picking Up and Returning</h4>
            <p>All pick ups and returns of Pro gear need to be done during the previously listed Pro hours. Equipment will be prepared and picked up for you prior to your arrival so all you need to do is sign and initial the forms in the necessary spaces.</p>
            <p>When returning the equipment, please do so by your return times. Because of the irregular hours that Pro employees keep, the items will be returned at their earliest convenience. You will receive an email when the return is complete to come back to PPECS and sign the forms if there is nothing wrong with the equipment.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h3>Master Control</h3>
            <p>While similar to PPECS, Master Control has some different nuances to its process. Here is a step by step guide to using MCR.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Park Cards</h4>
            <p>Before we get started, you need to pick up your Park Card from PPECS and have it validated. The Park Card is a form of Identification that tells the Master Control staff who you are and must be cross-referenced with your Student I.D. when you pick up a resource.</p>
            <p>In addition, Master Control will take your Park card when using a resource, and exchange it for a small placard indicating what room and station you have. You must return that placard when returning the resource to MCR.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Authorizations</h4>
            <p>Just like at PPECS you will be authorized for rooms and resources based on the classes that you are enrolled in. For example, if you are only in a photo course, you will be authorized to use the photo editing labs, but won’t be authorized for the video editing labs.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reservations</h4>
            <p>Creating a reservation for MCR works the same as PPECS, you may complete one on your own on the Patron Portal website or at the reservation desk at PPECS. You do not make a reservation inside of Master Control.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Patron Portal</h4>
            <p>If you are making reservations on Patron Portal your reservation must be made at least 24 hours in advance of you picking up the resource. Input your reservation pickup and return times before you begin, because this may affect what resources are available and for how long.</p>
            <p>Click on the add resources tab and start selecting what resources you would like! You will only be able to view what reservable resources that you are authorized for, so if you don’t see something, you are more than likely not authorized for it.</p>
            <p>Some rooms are only allowed to be checked out to a single patron for a specific amount of time, so keep this in mind while making your reservation.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Reservation Desk</h4>
            <p>The reservation desk in PPECS is open from 1PM-4PM Monday through Thursday and 1PM - 3PM on Fridays.</p>
            <p>A reservation at the reservation desk does not need to be made 24 hours in advance of your pickup time, but the reservation cannot be made for the same calendar day.</p>
            <p>A PPECS checkout staff employee will assist you in creating the reservation straight into WebCheckout. They will begin by asking you your pickup and return times, and then adding whatever resource you need.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Picking Up Resources</h4>
            <p>When picking up a resource, please show up a few minutes early to your pickup time, just to be sure that if there’s a line, you still are there on time. Keep in mind, you aren’t the only student PPECS has to help, so wait your turn. A reservation will be held for 15 minutes after the time it was supposed to be picked up, otherwise it is automatically returned in the system and becomes available to other students.</p>
            <p>When coming to pick up your resources, have your Park Card and Student I.D. ready. This is how they will verify who you are and what you are authorized for. The MCR staff will check out the resource to you in WebCheckout after you provide them your Park Card. They will then trade your Park Card with a small placard indicating what room and station you have. You must hold onto this placard until you return the resource.</p>
            <p>You may extend the time of your use of the resource at any point as long as no other reservations would be affected.</p>
            <p>If you need equipment from PPECS for your shoot, go and pick that up first. Once you give your Park Card to MCR you aren’t able to get it back until you return the resource.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>Returning Resources</h4>
            <p>Once you are done using your resource, please return it to the state that you found it in, or even cleaner. This ensures that the next student to use the space will have the same experience as you did.</p>
            <p>If you do not return the resources to its original state, this may result in the removal of your Park Card.</p>
            <p>When returning resources you must bring the little placard that MCR gave you back to the staff and they will return your Park Card to you. Once you have your Park Card, you are on your way!</p>
